Box includes:
   
  Phone, Data cable, Soft transparent back cover, wall power adapter and user manual.
   
  Pros:
   
  + Super smart phone
   
  + Excellent build quality
   
  + Gorgeous display
   
  + Very good rear camera with DSLR grade bokeh, it is one of the best under 25K.
   
  + Sleek, sturdy and very premium
   
  + One of the best selfie in the market under 25K.
   
  + No heat, no lagging.
   
  + Dual band WiFi
   
  + Smooth performance from SD-636 coupled with 4GB RAM.
   
  + Great connectivity package - 4G, Dual SIM, FM Radio, WiFi
   
  + Above average sunlight legibility.
   
  Cons:
   
  - No Oreo out of the box.
   
  - No NFC
   
  - Protruding camera lens
   
  - Average speaker loudness.
   
   
  I don't see any mobile as good as this under 18K except last year's Huawei flagships Huawei P9 and Honor 8, Samsung Galaxy S7 &amp; Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1.
   
  Huawei phones have better cameras, better display, same performance and NFC and better low light photography but with smaller display size and and no FM.
   
  S7 has better display which vivid and more punchy, double resolution, superior camera, 4K video recording, better low light photography and Samsung Pay.
   
  Zenfone Pro Max 1 has better display, better sunlight legibility, better battery life, better speaker, equally good camera and quick Android update.
   
   
  Easily recommended under 18K.

Bought this product for my wife, because she was fed up with her iPhone which she bought only a few months back. She has been praising this phone ever since she got it.
   
  Pros:
   
  1. Face unlock works accurately
   
  2. Great and sharp display (18:9)
   
  3. Brilliant Camera (Front and Back)
   
  4. Great Battery Life
   
  5. Great thin cover for free
   
  6. Phone is very slim and looks classy
   
  7. MIUI 9 is faster than its previous versions
   
  8. Great value for money
   
   
  Cons:
   
  1. Screen might be a little bigger for some people's taste
   
  2. You've to press the power button to use face unlock feature. (Tip: Use Gravity Screen to get around this.)
   
  3. I'm really trying hard to look for cons but couldn't find any till now.

Review Title : Review & tricks to get phone on flash sale

Upvotes : 282

Review Content :
Its a very good phone for this price range. The black variant of this phone is too good. Had compared with other color which friends has &amp; black variant is really looking exceptional.
   
   
  And for people who are finding it difficult to order the phone in flash sale, I have  small tips for you.
   
   
  Usually flash sale get started at 11.59 and with in seconds it gets over. But what i did is, i kept on refreshing again and again for another 30 min and the product got pops up again. I got the phone available for checkout at 12.18 PM.
   
   
  So keep on refreshing the page for at least 30 min. You will get the phone.
   
   
  If it is getting added to cart and you was not able to check out, don't remove from the cart as its easy to refresh the cart page again and again and the moment continue button gets enabled click it.
   
   
  Another Tip : If you are able to add to cart and not able to check out.. Don't remove it from cart. Let it be there till next flash sale and it will be easy for you as its already in the cart. You just have to wait and keep of refreshing your cart.
   
   
  Happy purchase. :)

  Speaker : 9/10(in headphone usage)
   
  Ram Management : 9/10 (2gb always used)(2gb getting free out of 4gb) but processing is so fast may be ram clearance is showing wrong

Pros-
   
  Both rear and front camera is good.
   
  Both rear and front flash works great on low light photography.
   
  Portrait mode is nice.
   
  Battery backup is good.
   
  Stylish and slim.
   
  Blue colour is attractive and beautiful.
   
  Finger print sensor works quickly.
   
  Best phone within 20k.
   
  Cons-
   
  Flipkart flash sale is not good. I have to wait for 3 weeks.

Sent me a defective  handset which is having heating &amp; battery draining issue, my handset reaching 45 to 48c heat and battery is getting drained with in 6 to 7 hours of minimum usage when i have reported the issue they are ready to time pass on it rather than solving it. The Technical guys who visited my house spent 5 min of time and play some Youtube videos and decides that the handset is working fine they don't use any tools they don't run any diagnostics to check the issue and they will be ready to close the case by showing that technical person has helped to solve the issue. After killing 10 days when i have reported the same thing they have come up with an answer that your 10 days time has passed and your are not eligible.

This Phone is Just Fabulous!!
   
  First of all Thanks to Flipkart &amp; Ekart Logistics for delivering the product before completing 24 hours of placing the order !!
   
  Phone was well packed and I loved it ..
   
  In Packet Accessories:
   
  Phone, Back Cover, Travel Adaptor, Data Cable, SIM Ejection Pin
   
   
  Pros:
   
  * Premium Design
   
  * 18:9 Aspect Ratio Display
   
  * Rounded Display Corners
   
  * Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 Processor
   
  * Huge 4000 mAh Battery
   
  * Front &amp; Rear Camera both are awesome
   
   
  Cons:
   
  * No USB Type-C in 2018
   
   
  That's my first impressions of Redmi Note 5 Pro !!
   
  This is truly India's Camera Beast !!
   
   
  (UPDATE)
   
  Full Review after 15 Days usage:
   
   
  Used it for 15 days as my primary smartphone and I must say that you won't find better option than Redmi Note 5 Pro under 15K-17K price range.
   
   
  Design is personal preference and I loved the design very much. It's easy to hold in a single hand. Battery easily lasts for 1.5 days in a single charge with moderate usage.
   
   
  Voice/Video Call quality is excellent! Display is crisp and smooth. Rear camera quality is just superb! 20MP front camera is outstanding and it takes perfect portrait selfies and low light selfies as it's having front facing flash. And the built quality of the phone is outstanding! I just feel a premium smartphone in my hand when I hold this phone! I love the MIUI because it provides lots of customizations.
   
   
  My Rating:
   
    Battery: 5/5
   
    Built Quality: 4.7/5
   
    Camera: 4.7/5
   
    Call Quality: 4.5/5
   
    UI Experience: 4.6/5
   
   
  GO FOR THIS SMARTPHONE WITHOUT ANY CONFUSION !! THE BEST REDMI EVER !!   
   
   
  Thank you so much.. :)

It's a swag phone.  I had been trying since the first sale but at last i got my hands on this.   It is a totally beast phone at this price.  1. The SDN636 PROCESSOR IS ULTRA FAST Which makes the device very fluid  2.  The Camera Quality is Wonderful both front and rear and REALLY IT IS INDIA'S CAMERA BEAST @14k    3.Adreno 509 GPU provides fantastic graphics when you play immersive games like asphalt 8,       4.The screen quality is gorgeous  and feels like an  amoled display.  5. Battery backup is insane.

All feature are cool  . Portrait mode works same like DSLR as compared to mobile camera lense. Because mobile camera lense are Small and DSLR was large with many inbuilt lense. Camera 9/10. Display 10/10. Design 9/10. I prefer original back cover which gives very good feeling. It's really beats all Oppo vivo phone.

Phone is perfect now at this price bracket without any competitors around as companies own MI A1 permanently discontinued.
   
  Coming to verdict- my opinion the phone should be priced at 13000/- during launch. As first few batches come impoted from China henceforth the price. Made in China with manufactured during January. So the question arises how Mi sold 3 lakh phones actually they have not. As always the screen has lots of stack/dead pixels, not really noticed unless you are in full brightness and full black screen.
   
  Coming to camera quality - front camera quality has improved a lot. Back camera can take decent photos in daylight. Lowlight &amp; indoor shots are unusable. EIS in video is outstanding.
   
   
  Amazing battery life no heating issue. Don't worry if you cannot buy during first few sales just try next time.

This much hype for this phone is too much. The time where company used to wait for customer is long gone, the so called new marketing strategy of making people to wait for product is becoming a trend.
   
   
  waiting for almost three months to book this product. After so many attempts to get hold of this device, finally I got it in my hand. But the feeling is more or less usual; holding a regular phone with usual display. don't expect anything remarkably fascinating out here.
